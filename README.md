# Screensaver in Python

This project is a simple recreation of the classic DVD bouncing logo screensaver using Python and Pygame.

## Features
- a logo or shape that bounces around the screen.
- Changes color when hitting the edges.
- Adjustable speed and window size.

## Requirements
Make sure you have Python installed (3.x recommended) and install Pygame:
```sh
pip install pygame
```

## How It Works
- The logo moves at a constant speed across the screen.
- When it collides with a wall, it bounces off and changes color.
- The movement is controlled using Pygame's game loop.

## Usage
Run the script with:
```sh
python screensaver.py
```

## Code Overview
1. Initialize Pygame and create a window.
2. Load a DVD logo image or generate a simple shape.
3. Set the initial movement direction and speed.
4. Continuously update the logo's position.
5. Detect collisions with the screen boundaries and adjust direction.
6. Change the color of the logo on impact.

## Customization
- Modify the screen size in the script.
- Change the speed of movement.
-you can use a customized logo instead of a shape
